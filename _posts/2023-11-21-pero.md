Our Apple Watch password manager ‚Äî Pero is [ready for sale (¬£4.99)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pero/id6452802397). 

We started with the smallest canvas. The project was inspired by revolutionary changes in [watchOS 10](https://www.apple.com/uk/watchos/watchos-10/). Pero works great on small screens while being powerful and capable. We would like to highlight a single feature ‚Äî tags. üè∑Ô∏è

### Tags.

We love tags, they allow you to do 3 cool things. 

- Organise your passwords by context, e.g. "home", "work"
- Assigning multiple tags to a single password
- Delete these tags without deleting passwords

The best thing about how we implement tags in Pero is that the Apple Watch interface hides some of the complexity and presents your data as classic single-layer folder-based navigation. This makes managing tags on Apple Watch easier than traditional tags + folders interfaces.

It's been a thrilling and productive developer story.
