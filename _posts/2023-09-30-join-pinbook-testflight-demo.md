We are thrilled to announce the first public demo of our newest product. 

[Join PINBook beta testing now.](https://testflight.apple.com/join/k5fOnkxq)

The demo is free to join and you will be able to experience all the features first. There's no registration required and the process is anonymous.

### Why you should be interested ###

PINBook allows you to save PIN codes and access them quickly and privately via Smart Stack or Accessory Rectangular complication.

✅ You own an Apple Watch  
✅ You need a quick way to access your frequently used PIN codes  
✅ You run iOS 17 paired with watchOS 10

If these are green for you, you should try PINBook. When we worked on PINBook, our goal was to create quality of life utility function. Because people carry their watches all day long, PINBook can save chunks of time through brief interactions.

### Features ###

- Organise PIN codes by tag, like Home and Work.
- Generate new PIN codes
- The data is only stored on your Apple Watch
- Polished watchOS 10 look and feel

### Business Model ###

- The app will cost something
- All the features, and possibly more, will be available for those who buy the app
- All the current features of the Apple Watch will be available as long as possible without an ongoing subscription
- We might add more features to the iOS Companion app, and we will likely offer a subscription for using these more elaborate features
