I am thrilled to announce, we are launching the first public demo for our newest product. 

[Join PINBook beta testing now.](https://testflight.apple.com/join/k5fOnkxq)

The demo is free to join and you will be able to experience all the features first. There's no registration required and the process is anonymous.

### Why you should be interested ###

This Apple Watch app allows you to save PIN codes and access them quickly and privately via Smart Stack or Accessory Rectangular complication. 

✅ You own an Apple Watch  
✅ You need a quick way to access your frequently used PIN codes  
✅ You run iOS 17 paired with watchOS 10

If this these green for you, you must try PINBook. My goal is to improve your comfort of life. I use PINBook just for a week and already benefit from it daily.

### Features ###

- Organise PIN codes by tag, like Home and Work.
- Generate new PIN codes
- The data is only stored on your Apple Watch
- Polished watchOS 10 look and feel

### Business Model ###

- The app will cost something
- All the features, and possibly more, will be available for those who buy the app
- All the current features of the Apple Watch will be available as long as possible without an ongoing subscription
- We might add more features to the iOS Companion app, and we will likely offer a subscription for using these more elaborate features
