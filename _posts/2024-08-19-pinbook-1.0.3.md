Backup your passwords via encrypted iMessage using the new Share button which allows you to export the Pinbook database in open JSON format. 

Pinbook is not backed up to iCloud. If you buy a new iPhone or erase your Apple Watch and restore it from backup, your passwords will not be restored. It's a watchOS limitation which applies to all third-party apps. We are working towards a solution for this limitation.

## 1.0.3

• "Pinbook" is the new app name.
• Apple Watch – Adds two new default groups "Recent" and "Widget".
• Widget — Pick a widget for the Smart Stack using default suggestions: "First Six", "Last Six", and "Widget".
• Widget – Fixes issue with Smart Stack updating and improves performance.
• Apple Watch — Adds new symbols.
• Apple Watch — Adds green tag colour.
• Password Wizard — Improved state restoration for generated passwords.

## 1.0.2

• Apple Watch App — Backup your passwords using Share button.
• App Name — Pero is now Pinbook. We only updated the App Store name first, to make sure no one else can use it. The app is still called "Pero" when running on your devices. We will update app files in the future.
