A significant update to LinkEdit with changes how metdata is managed. Metadata stores connections you make between your notes in a single JSON file.

**New**
- Metadata is moved to every project Default Folder, inside the `.linkedit` hidden directory to help with syncing
- New toolbar icons with better arrangement
- Toolbar now hides unavailable actions 
- Improved Default Folder switching experience
- Delete button is now always enabled in the main menu
- Default Folder is now always expanded by default
- Smaller default font sizes
- LinkEdit now persists note selection even when you change a selected folder
- Clicking on a linked note will now open it in a new window, with sidebars hidden
- In addition to Quick Link `Command+K`, now you can link by typing `linkedit://open` followed by a note name [Pro] 
- Metadata will update itself if there's a new link found in a note [Pro]

**Fixed**
- Fixed "File â†’ New Note" command. It now always adds new file to a selected folder
- Fixed the `linkedit://open` URL scheme when opening LinkEdit notes from external applications
- Notes sorting no longer depends on capitalisation which matches Finder behaviour
- Fixed issue with Quick Open incorrect state restoration
- Preventing metadata mutation if deleting or renaming notes fails
- More robust links and backlinks auto-updating during note renaming
- Fixed Links Inspector text alignment
- Fixed the notes sidebar showing old folder name when renaming a selected folder
- Fixed the editor problems after renaming a folder with selected note
- Fixed the metadata loss issue which happened when you have 2 notes with the same name and one of them linked. Then if you delete the other note you would lose a backlink from the first note
- Reduced Metadata file size by 50%
