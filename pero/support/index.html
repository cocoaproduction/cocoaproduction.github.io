<h3 id="intro">Introduction.</h3>

<p>The first thing you see when you open Pero on your Apple Watch is the list of groups. We also refer to them as "tags". The purpose of this list is to allow you to organise your passwords by context. You can think about them as traditional folders or labels. You also can use the default "All Items" group and delete the rest of the groups.</p>

<img alt="List of groups" width="25%" src="/images/pero-manual/groups.png"> 

<p>You are presented with the default <i>"All Items"</i> group on top followed by "Home" and "Work" groups. Each group can have a name, colour, and icon.</p>

<p>Groups are presented in alphabetical order. The default group on top is always present and can't be deleted. It contains every password. This allows you to delete "home", and "work" groups, without deleting your passwords.</p>

<p>Pressing on any of the groups displays passwords which belong to this group.</p>

<p>Reaching the end of the list presents the <i>New Tag</i> button. Use it for creating new groups.</p>

<h3 id="new-password">Creating a new password.</h3>

<p>Pero allows you to create new passwords and passcodes right on your Apple Watch.</p>

<p>Select the <i>All Items</i> group, then tap <img src="/images/pero-manual/plus-button-grey.png" width="23px"> button to open the password editor.</p>

<img src="/images/pero-manual/password-wizard.png" alt="Modal screen showing 2 tedt fields for password name and password itself, and a single generate button">

<p>You can either enter a password yourself or let Pero generate a new numeric passcode. To enter it yourself press on the second text field with the <i>1234</i> placeholder. To generate a new passcode, tap the <i>Generate</i> button.</p>

<p>Optionally assign a name for your password. Tap on the first text field with the <i>Locker</i> placeholder.</p>

<p>Optionally tap <i>Browse Icons</i> to assign a custom icon to your password, it's useful when looking up your passwords from <a href="#widget">the widget</a>.</p> 

<p>Once you are done, tap <i>Save.</i></p>

<h3 id="editor">Password editor.</h3>

<p>Tap on a password to change it.</p>

<img src="/images/pero-manual/editor.png" alt="Modal screen which appears on top of selected password, screenshot shows remove from home button, red remove button and share button">

<p>Tap <i>Remove from...</i> to remove a password from the selected group.</p>

<p>Delete a password by pressing on the red <i>Remove...</i> button.</p>

<p>Tap <i>Share</i> to share a password and its name.</p>

<p>Changes are saved automatically. Tap the back arrow to dismiss the editor.</p>

<h3 id="tagEditor">Group editor.</h3>

<p>On the first screen, tap <img src="/images/pero-manual/accessory-button.png"> button to open the editor.</p>

<img alt="Apple Watch with modal screen on top of the groups list, 1 text field wich says work, 2 buttons - browse icons and colours and remove" src="/images/pero-manual/group-wizard.png">

<p>The editor appears on top of your groups allowing you to rename a group, assign a custom icon, and colour.</p>

<p>Tap <i>Remove...</i> to remove this group without deleting its passwords.</p>

<h3 id="picker">Password picker.</h3>

<p>The password picker allows you to add new and existing passwords to a group.</p>

<p>Select a group, then tap <img alt="Circular add button with a plus" src="/images/pero-manual/add-button.png"> button to open the password picker.</p>

<img alt="Password picker" src="/images/pero-manual/passwords-picker.png">

<p>This screen shows a list of all the passwords which don't belong to a currently selected group. In the picture above you can see that a selected group contains all the passwords except the "Office Locker". Tapping "Office Locker" will add it to a selected group.</p>

<p>Tap <i>New Password</i> to <a href="#new-password">create</a> a new password or a passcode.</p>

<p>Tap on any of the passwords in the list to add it to the group.</p>

<h3 id="widget">Smart Stack widget.</h3>

<p>Smart Stack is a new way of presenting the most relevant data from all of your Apple Watch apps as widgets. Opening Apple Watch apps can take some time, and you usually don't have that time in the heat of a moment.</p>

<img class="screenshot" alt="Apple Watch Smart Stack showing Pero widget with 4 short passcodes." src="/images/pero-hero_2x.png" style="width: 220px; padding-bottom: 0;">

<p>We recommend adding at least one Pero widget to your Smart Stack. You can even add multiple widgets from a single application. For example, if you have 2 groups in Pero, you can add both of them as separate widgets.</p>

<p>To enter Smart Stack swipe from the bottom of your Apple Watch face, or rotate Digital Crown. Then use <b>a long press</b> to enter editing mode and add new widgets by pressing the + button. Find Pero in the list of suggested apps, and pick a group which you would like to add. You even can add the "All Items" group which contains all of your passwords. However because widgets are constrained in size, you only can see up to 6 passwords. When you going to have more passwords, organise them in groups.</p>

<p>Please refer to this handy guide from Apple â€” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/watch/apdecf142fb9/watchos">Use the Smart Stack to show timely widgets on Apple Watch</a>.</p>
