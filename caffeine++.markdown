### Apple Health access

Caffeine++ works best with read and write access to caffeine, water, sugar, and calories data.

#### Read access

Allows us to display how much coffee you had directly in Caffeine++. We only store this data locally and erase everything older than 1 week. We even can display data you manually enter in Apple Health or data you log through other caffeine trackers from the App Store.

#### Write access

Allows us to save your data into Apple Health for archiving. You can deny any of the write permissions and rely only on the app storage, however, we store your data locally only for 1 week.

### Privacy summary

- Caffeine++ can use Apple Health access for storing data and displaying daily summary.
- Caffeine++ doesn‚Äôt require any personal user details to be entered anywhere in the app.
- Caffeine++ and its creators can not be held responsible for any incorrect user data entered in the app.
- Any user generated data that is entered from Caffeine++ is only stored on a users iPhone and, optionally, on Apple servers.
- We may store your email address for some time if you send support email to us within the app.
